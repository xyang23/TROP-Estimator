# TROP: Triply Robust Panel Estimator

`trop` is a Python package implementing the **Triply Robust Panel (TROP)** estimator for average treatment effects (ATEs) in panel data. The core estimator is expressed as a weighted two-way fixed effects (TWFE) objective, with an optional low-rank regression adjustment via a nuclear-norm penalty.
